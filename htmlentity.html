            Ok, so this last section doesn’t actually have anything to do with links or images, but we do need to
            discuss one more thing before switching gears into CSS. An “HTML entity” is a special character that can’t
            be represented as plain text in an HTML document. This typically either means it’s a reserved character in
            HTML or you don’t have a key on your keyboard for it.
            <br>

        <h2><u>Reserved Characters</u></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        The <,>, and & characters are called “reserved characters” because they aren’t allowed to be inserted into an
            HTML document without being encoded. This is because they mean something in the HTML syntax: < begins a new
                tag,> ends a tag, and, as we’re about to learn, & sets off an HTML entity.

                In misc/extras.html, add the following:
                <br>
                < h2>HTML Entities< /h2>
                        < p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
                            should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
                            <br>
                            Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). In between, you
                            put a special
                            code that your browser will interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets lt, gt, and
                            amp as
                            less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respectively.

                            <br>
                            <h2><u>Quotes</u></h2>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Curly quotes are by no means necessary, but if you care about typography they’ll be some of
                            the most common HTML entities you’ll use. There’s four different kinds of curly quotes
                            (opening and closing single and double quotes):
                            <br>
                            <pre>
(SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)

                            & ldquo;
                            & rdquo;
                            & lsquo;
                            & rsquo;
                            <br>
                            You can use them in place of ' and " straight quotes, like so:

                            < p>If you& rsquo;re into & ldquo;web typography,& rdquo; you& rsquo;ll also find
                                yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.< /p>
                          <br>
</pre>
                            Unlike straight quotes, these curly quote entities should hug the text.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <h2><u>UTF-8 And HTML Entities</u></h2>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the olden days of the web, HTML files weren’t allowed to have special characters in them,
                            making entities much more useful. But, since we’re now using a UTF-8 character set, we
                            should be able to insert any character directly into the HTML document. This makes entities
                            primarily useful as reserved characters or for convenience when authoring straight HTML.
                            <br>
                            <br>
