        <h1>Memory Management</h1>
       <hr>
      <p> C language provides many functions that come in header files to deal with the allocation and management of memories. In this tutorial, you will find brief information about managing memory in your program using some functions and their respective header files.</p>

        <p>Table of Contents <br><br>
        Management of Memory <br>
        static memory allocations <br>
        dynamic memory allocations <br><br>
       Almost all computer languages can handle system memory. All the variables used in your program occupies a precise memory space along with the program itself, which needs some memory for storing itself (i.e., its own program). Therefore, managing memory utmost care is one of the major tasks a programmer must keep in mind while writing codes. <br></p>
       
       <p>When a variable gets assigned in a memory in one program, that memory location cannot be used by another variable or another program. So, C language gives us a technique of allocating memory to different variables and programs. <br></p>
       
      <p> There are two types used for allocating memory. These are: <br><br>
       
       In the static memory allocation technique, allocation of memory is done at compilation time, and it stays the same throughout the entire run of your program. Neither any changes will be there in the amount of memory nor any change in the location of memory. <br><br>
       
       In dynamic memory allocation technique, allocation of memory is done at the time of running the program, and it also has the facility to increase/decrease the memory quantity allocated and can also release or free the memory as and when not required or used. Reallocation of memory can also be done when required. So, it is more advantageous, and memory can be managed efficiently. </p>
