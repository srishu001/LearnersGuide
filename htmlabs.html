        <hr>
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;">
            Now that we’re working with links, we need to understand how a website is structured. For our purposes, a
            website is just a collection of HTML files organized into folders. To refer to those files from inside of
            another file, the Internet uses “uniform resource locators” (URLs). Depending on what you’re referring to,
            URLs can take different forms. The three types of URLs we’ll be dealing with are highlighted below:

            <br>
            <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/absolute-relative-root-relative-links-104560.png"
                height="300" width="500">
            <br>
            Absolute, relative, and root-relative links refer to the value of the href attribute. The next few sections
            will explain how and when to use each of them. But first, let’s add the following content to our links.html
            file:
            <br>
        <pre>
            (SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)
        < p>
        This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:
        < /p>

        < ul>
            < !-- Add <li> elements here -->
        < /ul>
            </pre>
        <br>

        <h2><u>Absolute links</u></h2>

        “Absolute” links are the most detailed way you can refer to a web resource. They start with the “scheme”
        (typically http:// or https://), followed by the domain name of the website, then the path of the target web
        page.
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/absolute-link-syntax-64d730.png"
            height="300" width="500">
        <br>
        For example, try creating a link to the Mozilla Developer Network’s HTML element reference:
        <br>
        <pre>
            (SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)


< li>Absolute links, like to
    < a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla
    Developer Network< /a>, which is a very good resource for web
    developers.< /li>
        </pre>
        It’s possible to use absolute links to refer to pages in your own website, but hard-coding your domain name
        everywhere can make for some tricky situations. It’s usually a better idea to reserve absolute links only for
        directing users to a different website.
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/absolute-links-32f469.png"
            height="300" width="500">
        <br>

        <h2><u>Relative links</u></h2>
        <br>
        “Relative” links point to another file in your website from the vantage point of the file you’re editing. It’s
        implied that the scheme and domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing you need to supply
        is the path.
        <br>
        Here’s how we can link to our extras.html file from inside of links.html:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre>
            (SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)

        < li>Relative links, like to our < a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
                page< /a>.< /li></pre>
        <br>
        In this case, the href attribute represents the file path to extras.html from the links.html
        file. Since
        extras.html isn’t in the same folder as links.html, we need to include the misc folder in the
        URL.
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/relative-links-e178d0.png"
            height="300" width="500">
        <br>
        Each folder and file in a path is separated by a forward slash (/). So, if we were trying to get
        to a file that was two folders deep, we’d need a URL like this:
        <br>
        mis c/other-folder/extras.html
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2><u>Parent Folders</u></h2>
        <br>

        That works for referring to files that are in the same folder or a deeper folder. What about
        linking to pages that are in a directory above the current file? Let’s try creating relative
        links to links.html and images.html from within our extras.html file. Add this to extras.html:

        <br>
        <pre>
            (SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)

                        < p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may
                            also be interested in  < a href='links.html'>links< /a> or
                             < a href='images.html'>images< /a>.
                        < /p>
        </pre>
        When you click either of those links in a web browser, it will complain that the page doesn’t
        exist. Examining the address bar, you’ll discover that the browser is trying to load
        misc/links.html and misc/images.html—it’s looking in the wrong folder! That’s because our links
        are relative to the location of extras.html, which lives in the misc folder.
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/relative-link-no-parent-4629d0.png"
            height="300" width="500">
        <br>

        To fix this, we need the .. syntax. Two consecutive dots in a file path represent a pointer to the parent
        directory:
        <br>
        <pre>
            (SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)

        < p>
        This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be
            interested in < a href='../links.html'>links< /a> or < a href='../images.html'>images< /a>.< /p>
        </pre>

        This is like saying, “I know extras.html is in the misc folder. Go up a folder and look for links.html and
        images.html in there.”
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/relative-link-with-parent-666b79.png"
            height="300" width="500">
        <br>
        To navigate up through multiple directories, use multiple .. references, like so:
        <br>
        ../../elsewhere.html
        <br>
        Relative links are nice because they let you move around entire folders without having to update all the href’s
        on your < a> elements, but they can get a little confusing when all your links start with a bunch of dots.
            They’re best for referring to resources in the same folder or in a standalone section of your website.

            For example, all the images in HTML & CSS Is Hard are loaded with relative URLs (we’ll learn how to do
            images a moment). This allows us to rename any of our chapter slugs without having to update all our image
            paths.
            <br>

            <h2><u>Root-Relative Links</u></h2>
            <br>
            “Root-relative” links are similar to the previous section, but instead of being relative to the current
            page, they’re relative to the “root” of the entire website. For instance, if your website is hosted on
            our-site.com, all root-relative URLs will be relative to our-site.com.
            <br>
            <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/root-relative-links-368060.png"
                height="300" width="500">
            <br>
            Unfortunately, there is one caveat to our discussion of root-relative links: this entire tutorial uses local
            HTML files instead of a website hosted on a web server. This means we won’t be able to experiment with
            root-relative links. But, if we did have a real server, the link to our home page would look like this:
<br>
<br>
            < !-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
            < li>Root-relative links, like to the < a href='/'>home page< /a> of our website,
                but those aren't useful to us right now.< /li>
                <br>
                <br>
            The only difference between a root-relative link and a relative one is that the former starts with a forward
            slash. That initial forward slash represents the root of your site. You can add more folders and files to
            the path after that initial slash, just like relative links. The following path will work correctly no
            matter where the current page is located (even in misc/extras.html):
            <br>

            /images.html
            <br>
            Root-relative links are some of the most useful kinds of links. They’re explicit enough to avoid the
            potential confusion of relative links, but they’re not overly explicit like absolute links. You’ll see a lot
            of them throughout your web development career, especially in larger websites where it’s hard to keep track
            of relative references.
