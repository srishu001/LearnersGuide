        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Empty HTML Elements</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <p>
The HTML tags we’ve encountered so far either wrap text content (e.g., < p>) or other HTML elements (e.g., < ol>). 
That’s not the case for all HTML elements. Some of them can be “empty“ or “self-closing”. 
Line breaks and horizontal rules are the most common empty elements you’ll find.

<h2><u>Line breaks</u></h2>

HTML condenses consecutive spaces, tabs, or newlines (together known as “whitespace”) into a single space. 
To see what we’re talking about, add the following section to our basics.html file:
<br>
<pre>
(SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)
< h2>Empty Elements <  /h2>
< p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.< /p>
 <p>Regards 
    The Authors< /p></pre>
The newline after Regards in the above snippet will be transformed into a space instead of displaying as a line break:
<br>
<img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/html-collapsing-whitespace-c4012d.png" height="300" width="500">
<br>

This behavior may seem counter intuitive, but web developers often set their text editor to limit line length to 
around 80 characters. As a programmer, it’s easier to manage code this way,
 but having each of the newlines show up in the rendered page would severely mess up the intended page layout.
To tell the browser that we want a hard line break, we need to use an explicit < br/> element, like this:
<br>
<pre>
(SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)

< p>Regards,< br/>
The Authors< /p></pre>

The < br/> element is useful anywhere text formatting matters. Haiku, music lyrics, and 
signatures are just a few examples where it might come in handy.

<br>
<img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/html-line-break-element-f40443.png" height="300" width="500">
<br>

However, be very careful not to abuse the < br/> tag. Each one you use should still convey meaning—you shouldn’t use it to, 
say add a bunch of space between paragraphs:
<br>
<pre>
(SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)
< !-- (You will be shunned for this) -->
< p>This paragraph needs some space below it...< /p>
< br/>< br/>< br/>< br/>< br/>< br/>< br/>< br/>
< p>So, I added some hard line breaks.< /p></pre>
As discussed in the previous section, this kind of presentational information 
should be defined in your CSS instead of your HTML.

<h2><u>Horizonal Rules</u></h2>

The < hr/> element is a “horizontal rule”, which represents a thematic break. 
The transition from one scene of a story into the next or between the end of a letter and a postscript are 
good examples of when a horizontal rule may be appropriate, For instance:

<br>
<pre>
(SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)
< h2>Empty Elements< /h2>
< p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.< /p>
 < p>Regards,< br/>
The Authors< /p>
< hr/>
< p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
soon.< /p></pre>

One of the themes for this chapter has been the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), 
and < hr/> is no different. Like < em> and < strong>, it has a default appearance (a horizontal line), 
but once we start working with CSS, we’ll be able to render it as more space between sections, 
a decorative accent character, or pretty much anything else we want.

<br>
<img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/html-horizontal-rule-element-49f526.png" height="300" width="500">
<br>

Like < br/>, < hr/> should carry meaning—don’t use it when you just want to display a line for the sake of aesthetics.
 For that, you’ll want to use the CSS border property, which we’ll discuss in a few chapters.
Another way to think about the < hr/> element is that it carries less significance than the separation 
created by a new heading element, but more significance than a new paragraph.

<h2><u>Optional Trailing slash</u></h2>

The trailing slash (/) in all empty HTML elements is entirely optional.
 The above snippet could also be marked up like this (note the lack of / in the < br> and < hr> tags):
 <br>
 <pre>
 (SPACES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE HTML CODING , SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EXECUTED)

 < p>Regards,< br>
The Authors< /p>
< hr>
 </pre>

It doesn’t really make a difference which convention you choose, but pick one and stick to it for the sake of consistency. 
In this tutorial, we’ll be including the trailing / character because it clearly shows that it’s a self-closing element. 
This will help prevent your eyes from searching for the closing tag elsewhere in the document.
