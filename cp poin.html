        <h1>Pointer</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn about pointers; what pointers are, how do you use them and the common mistakes you might face when working with them with the help of examples.


        Pointers are powerful features of C and C++ programming. Before we learn pointers, let's learn about addresses in C programming.</p>
        <h3>Address in c</h3>
        <p>If you have a variable var in your program, &var will give you its address in the memory.

            We have used address numerous times while using the scanf() function.
            
            </p>
       <p><b><br>scanf("%d", &var);</b></p>
       
       <h3>Benefit of Pointer</h3>
       <p>Pointers allow passing of arrays and strings to functions more efficiently. <br><br>
        Pointers make it possible to return more than one value from the function. <br>
        Pointers reduce the length and complexity of a program. <br><br>
        Pointers increase the processing speed. <br><br>
        Pointers save the memory. <br></p>

        <p>Here, the value entered by the user is stored in the address of var variable. Let's take a working example.</p>
        <p><b>  #include < stdio.h> <br>
            int main() <br>
            {<br>
              int var = 5;<br>
              printf("var: %d\n", var); <br><br>
            
              // Notice the use of & before var <br>
              printf("address of var: %p", &var);  <br><br>
              return 0;<br>
            } <br></b></p>
        <p>Pointers (pointer variables) are special variables that are used to store addresses rather than values.</p>
        <p><u>Pointer Syntex :</u></p>
    <p><b><br>int* p;</b></p>
    <p>Here, we have declared a pointer p of int type. <br>

        You can also declare pointers in these ways.</p>

        <p><b><br>int *p1;<br><br>
            int * p2; <br><br></b></p>

            <p>Assigning addresses to Pointers <br><br>
                Let's take an example. <br><br>
                
                int* pc, c; <br>
                c = 5;<br>
                pc = &c;<br>
                Here, 5 is assigned to the c variable. And, the address of c is assigned to the pc pointer. <br><br>
                
                Get Value of Thing Pointed by Pointers <br>
                To get the value of the thing pointed by the pointers, we use the * operator. For example: <br><br>
                
                int* pc, c; <br>
                c = 5; <br>
                pc = &c;<br>
                printf("%d", *pc);   // Output: 5 <br>
                Here, the address of c is assigned to the pc pointer. To get the value stored in that address, we used *pc. <br><br>
                
                Note: In the above example, pc is a pointer, not *pc. You cannot and should not do something like *pc = &c; <br><br>
                
                By the way, * is called the dereference operator (when working with pointers). It operates on a pointer and gives the value stored in that pointer. <br></p>
