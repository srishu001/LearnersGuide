        <p style="font-family:Verdana;">
            <br>
            There’s four main image formats in use on the web, and they were all designed to do different things.
            Understanding their intended purpose goes a long way towards improving the quality of your web pages.
            <br>
            <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/image-formats-62b23d.png"
                height="300" width="500">
            <br>
            The next few sections will walk through ideal use cases for each of these image formats. Make sure you’ve
            unzipped these mochi images into your links-and-images project before moving on.


        <h2><u>JPG Images</u></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes
        them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. On the other hand, JPGs don’t allow for
        transparent pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the image below if you look real close:
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/mochi-77c69d.jpg" height="200"
            width="200">
        <br>
        Embed this mochi.jpg image in our images.html page with the following snippet (this also includes a bit of
        navigation to our other pages):
        <br>
        <pre>

        < p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for 
        < a href='links.html'>links< /a> and 
        < a href='misc/extras.html'>usefulextras< /a>.< /p>
        < h2>JPGs< /h2>
        < p>JPG images are good for photos.< /p>
        < img src='images/mochi.jpg' />
</pre>
        <br>

        <h2><u>PNG Images</u></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated. For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as
        perceived the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do deal with
        opacity just fine, and they don’t have color palette limitations. This makes them an excellent fit for icons,
        technical diagrams, logos, etc.
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/mochi-f95fdf.png" height="200"
            width="200">
        <br>

        Let’s add this PNG image to our example project as well:

        <br>

        <h2><u>SVG Images</u></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or
        down to any dimension without loss of quality. This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive
        design. They’re good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can.
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/svg-vs-png-image-3df7fd.png"
            height="200" width="200">
        <br>
        These 300×300 pixel images were originally 100×100 pixels, but scaling them up clearly shows the difference
        between them. Notice the crisp, clean lines on the left SVG image, while the PNG image on the right is now very
        pixelated.

        Despite being a vector format, SVGs can be used exactly like their raster counterparts. Go ahead and add the
        mochi.svg to our images.html page:
        <br>
        <pre>

        < h2>SVGs< /h2>
        < p>SVGs are < em>amazing< /em>. Use them wherever you can.< /p>
        < img src='images/mochi.svg' />
        </pre>


        There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers, you need to convert
        any text fields to outlines using your image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch). If your images contain
        a lot of text (like the fancy screenshots in this tutorial), this can have a big impact on file size. For this
        reason, InternetingIsHard.com uses PNGs instead of SVGs, even though SVGs are so awesome.
